The technology that shapes the NE Sprawl is in its shipping and news publishing.  R.A.S’s (rigid air ships) take incoming cargo from sea-steadings in the Atlantic to skydocks throughout the sprawl, with drones orbiting them to fend off lightning.

New York City, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Albany, and Baltimore all reached out and became a single, cyclopean urban tumor.   The Sprawl has grown over old and dated political and geographical lines.  Because of a city that has outstripped the county, state and federal laws that once contained the cities cannot contain the crime within the sprawl.   Gated communities became walled townships and entire slums are off the grid or at best in areas with rolling brown-outs.

When water was privatized, corporations set up quasi-medieval fiefs in order to protect their stockholders’ resources.  Beyond the coast, the Atlantic Ocean is dotted with sea-steadings, each a city-state onto itself, some ruled by corporate shipping interests, others self-governed as industrial cooperative pirate-havens.

All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. I go all over. I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn, I take 'em to Harlem. I don't care. Don't make no difference to me. It does to some. Some won't even take spooks. Don't make no difference to me.
Thank God for the rain to wash the trash off the sidewalk.
I think someone should just take this city and just... just flush it down the fuckin' toilet.

None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with *ME*!

 I heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Life seems harsh, and cruel. Says he feels all alone in threatening world. Doctor says: "Treatment is simple. The great clown - Pagliacci - is in town. Go see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears. "But doctor..." he says "I am Pagliacci." Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.

 Dog carcass in alley this morning, tire tread on burst stomach. This city is afraid of me. I have seen its true face. The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout "Save us!"... and I'll whisper "no."

 Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon. That's always been the difference between us, Daniel.

  Men get arrested. Dogs get put down.
