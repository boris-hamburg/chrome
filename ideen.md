The technology that shapes the NE Sprawl is in its shipping and news publishing.  R.A.S’s (rigid air ships) take incoming cargo from sea-steadings in the Atlantic to skydocks throughout the sprawl, with drones orbiting them to fend off lightning.

New York City, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Albany, and Baltimore all reached out and became a single, cyclopean urban tumor.   The Sprawl has grown over old and dated political and geographical lines.  Because of a city that has outstripped the county, state and federal laws that once contained the cities cannot contain the crime within the sprawl.   Gated communities became walled townships and entire slums are off the grid or at best in areas with rolling brown-outs.

When water was privatized, corporations set up quasi-medieval fiefs in order to protect their stockholders’ resources.  Beyond the coast, the Atlantic Ocean is dotted with sea-steadings, each a city-state onto itself, some ruled by corporate shipping interests, others self-governed as industrial cooperative pirate-havens.

All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. I go all over. I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn, I take 'em to Harlem. I don't care. Don't make no difference to me. It does to some. Some won't even take spooks. Don't make no difference to me.
Thank God for the rain to wash the trash off the sidewalk.
I think someone should just take this city and just... just flush it down the fuckin' toilet.

None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with *ME*!

 I heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Life seems harsh, and cruel. Says he feels all alone in threatening world. Doctor says: "Treatment is simple. The great clown - Pagliacci - is in town. Go see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears. "But doctor..." he says "I am Pagliacci." Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.

 Dog carcass in alley this morning, tire tread on burst stomach. This city is afraid of me. I have seen its true face. The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout "Save us!"... and I'll whisper "no."

 Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon. That's always been the difference between us, Daniel.

  Men get arrested. Dogs get put down.

  While lucrative, the implant has cost Johnny his childhood memories, and he seeks to have the implant removed to regain his memories

  Johnny is told that the information exceeds his current memory capacity of 80 gigabytes, but he acquires a compression unit that effectively doubles the amount he can hold.

  NAS, also called "the black shakes", is caused by an overexposure to electromagnetic radiation from omnipresent technological devices, and is presented as a raging epidemic affecting the world in the future.

  he cityscapes of Hong Kong[30] and Shanghai[31] have had major influences in the urban backgrounds, ambiance and settings in many cyberpunk works such as Blade Runner and Shadowrun. Ridley Scott envisioned the landscape of cyberpunk Los Angeles in Blade Runner to be "Hong Kong on a very bad day".[32] The streetscapes of Ghost in the Shell were based on Hong Kong. Its director Mamoru Oshii felt that Hong Kong's strange and chaotic streets where "old and new exist in confusing relationships", fit the theme of the film well.[30] Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City is particularly notable for its disorganized hyper-urbanization and breakdown in traditional urban planning to be an inspiration to cyberpunk landscapes.

  One of the cyberpunk genre's prototype characters is Case, from Gibson's Neuromancer.[33] Case is a "console cowboy," a brilliant hacker who has betrayed his organized criminal partners. Robbed of his talent through a crippling injury inflicted by the vengeful partners, Case unexpectedly receives a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be healed by expert medical care but only if he participates in another criminal enterprise with a new crew.

Like Case, many cyberpunk protagonists are manipulated, placed in situations where they have little or no choice, and although they might see things through, they do not necessarily come out any further ahead than they previously were. These anti-heroes—"criminals, outcasts, visionaries, dissenters and misfits"[34]—call to mind the private eye of detective fiction. This emphasis on the misfits and the malcontents is the "punk" component of cyberpunk.

Modern Tokyo already had the hallmarks of a cyberpunk world by the time Western authors were only dreaming of neon cathedrals overlooking thrumming, dirty streets.

 It explores the core transhumanist question to cyberpunk; what is the nature of being human in a world of increasingly advanced cybernetics?

- A man has accidentally copied his consciousness and hires the PCs to destroy the copy. The copy insists it’s the original.

- A hacker has figured out how to hack into people’s cyberbrains.

- A robot has been destroyed. It was a hate crime committed by androids who feel they are more “human” and thus superior.

- Due to increased automation, a dispossessed workforce has become a “Neo-luddite” faction, committing mass-vandalism (or murder?) of robots.

- A man sells a companion bot who has fallen in love with him, she flees her new owner to be with him.

- You taste things you're not eating, see things that aren't there, and have thoughts that aren't yours. Someone is hacking your neuroware.

Messing with a Megacorp is suicide. Heads will roll! The party members and employees who messed up. They get an unexpected reprieve, possibly just before the trigger of a very scary looking gun is pulled. A phone call comes through.. They're REALLY lucky, they'll get a temporary reprieve to break into another company on their behalf as expendables. Then, if they live, which should feel unlikely, they'll be in trouble with two different powerful corporations! Kill off some NPC they know very early on to show them how dangerous other NPC's are, on the slightest whim, or whim of a boss. From the moment they piss anyone off they should live in a constant state of paranoia, always on the move. The enemy will seem to come from nowhere They have all sorts of ways and means of finding you, like the Bourne films etc.

Bandwidth and processor space are the most valuable commodities, people are selling time in their brains to mine a bitcoin equivalent, but something's gone wrong and people aren't waking up.

Although there are areas of rich people in the Sprawl, a vast majority of the people struggle to survive from day to day. However, advanced technology is ubiquitous and accessible to all, regardless of financial standing. People spend much of their time in the "matrix" for work or recreational purposes. A common addiction for Sprawl inhabitants are "simstims" (simulated stimuli), a form of virtual reality that allows people to experience a television program, typically soap operas, from the point of view of a fictitious media personality.

A capsule hotel (Japanese: カプセルホテル, translit. kapuseru hoteru), also known as a pod hotel, is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of small bed-sized rooms known as capsules. Capsule hotels provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require or who cannot afford larger, more expensive rooms offered by more conventional hotels.

The open end of the capsule can be closed with a curtain or a solid door for privacy, but cannot be locked.[1]

Like a hostel, many amenities are communally shared, including toilets, showers, wireless internet, and dining rooms. In Japan, a capsule hotel may have a communal bath and sauna. Some hotels also provide restaurants, snack bars or bars (or at least vending machines), pools, and other entertainment facilities. There may be a lounge with upholstered chairs for relaxing, along with newspapers and reading material.[2]

The console beeps recognition of my card, mag-lock thunks open and the door cycles open. Echoes of bulky combat boots on wet concrete reverberate as I walk down the humid, strip-lit hallway. Condensation on the dark glass walls glisten as vague shapes move within the many rooms lining the passageway. Numbers glow above each doorway, red or blue. I hear a muffled cry and a thud behind one door and press my ear against the cool, wet glass
